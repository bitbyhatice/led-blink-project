# led-blink-project
My first Arduino project: blinking an LED using pin 8.

# Arduino LED Blink Project ðŸ’¡

This is my first Arduino project as an Electrical & Electronics Engineering student.

I connected an LED to pin 8 and made it blink every second using basic C code in the Arduino IDE.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Using `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()`
- Understanding `setup()` and `loop()` structure
- Building a basic circuit on breadboard
- Uploading code to Arduino Uno

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit
- 1 x LED
- 1 x 320Î© resistor
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## ðŸ§¾ Code

```c
void setup() {
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
